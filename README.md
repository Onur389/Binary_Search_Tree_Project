# Binary_Search_Tree_Project
Binary search tree project for patika.dev website

We use binary search tree algorithm for storing data easily and find the data that we need. Binary search tree algorithm is better than linear search and binary search on time complexity. It stores data as right and left. If data value is bigger than first data, it stores data as right side. If is smaller than first number, it stores data as left side.
