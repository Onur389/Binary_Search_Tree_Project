# Binary_Search_Tree_Project
Binary search tree project for patika.dev website

We use binary search tree algorithm for storing data easily and find the data that we need. Binary search tree algorithm is better than linear search and binary search on time complexity. It stores data as right and left. If data value is bigger than first data, it stores data as right side. If is smaller than first number, it stores data as left side. it has O(n) big-O notation and logn worst case time complexity.

Our data set is [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2].

Firstly, we should take an element from that set.
First element will be 7 randomly. Then, we select randomly at data set. If the selected element is smaller than 7, we will write it left to the 7. If it's bigger, then we will write it right to the 7.

             7
       5           8
  1       6          9
0  3
  2 4
  
We finally have this binary search tree. Root is 7. There is 8 right of the 7 and there is 9 right of the 8. There is 5 left of the seven , 1 left of the 5 , 0 left of the 1, 6 left of the 5. Also 3 right of the 1 , 2 left of the 3, 4 left of the 3.
